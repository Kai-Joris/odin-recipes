        <p><h1>Rosted Pork Tenderloin with Fresh Plum Source</h1></p>
        <p><img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F1398809.jpg"></p>
        <p>When shopping for this recipe be sure to choose plums (or any other stone fruit) that are fairly firm so they keep their shape after roasting.</p> 
        <p>You know that selfish jerk that has to feel-up every piece of fruit before deciding on one? This time, be that jerk.</p> 
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pork tenderloin</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 shallots, sliced</li>
            <li>3 fresh thyme sprigs, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 firm plums, pitted and each cut into 4 wedges</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cold butter</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Step 1</p>
                <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously season pork tenderloin with salt and black pepper.</p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 2</p>
                <p>Heat oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tenderloin until browned on all sides, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer tenderloin to a plate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 3</p>
                <p>Saute onion with a pinch of salt in the same skillet until just softening, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shallots, reduce heat to medium, and cook and stir until shallots and onion are golden brown and caramelized, about 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 4</p>
                <p>Stir thyme into onion mixture; place tenderloin over onion mixture, and set plum quarters, skin-side down, around pork tenderloin. Transfer skillet to preheated oven.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 5</p>
                <p>Cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork and plums to a plate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Step 6</p>
                <p>Place skillet over medium-high heat and pour water and balsamic vinegar into onion mixture. Bring mixture to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes; remove from heat. Whisk butter into mixture until melted and sauce is shiny. Pour sauce over pork and plums.</p>
